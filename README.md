# appimage

**Status: Early Development Phase**

## Overview

`appimage` is a Python module designed to facilitate the initialization of applications within an AppImage via AppRun. This module is specifically intended to be invoked by the AppRun script of an AppImage and is not meant for direct execution.

While `appimage` is still in its early development phase, a working example of its functionality is already utilized by the [SSH-MITM](https://github.com/ssh-mitm/ssh-mitm) project. The goal of this project is to extract the functionality provided by the appstart script in SSH-MITM and make it available for other projects.

## Features

- Simplifies the initialization process for Python applications within an AppImage.
- Compatible with virtual Python environments.
- Facilitates development by allowing the application to be updated directly within the virtual environment.
